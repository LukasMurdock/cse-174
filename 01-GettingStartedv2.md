# Getting Started With Programming

You know how to use a phone. You know how to interact with it and you can recreate its behavior in your mind–easy.

That confidence and experience came from hours, endless hours, of _working with it_.

It’s the same with programming.

It’s confusing at first. Sometimes nothing makes sense. You’ll read the code again and again, unable to find any mistake as the voice in your head becomes overbearing.

_I don’t know what I’m doing._

_Will I ever get good at this?…_

### Don’t panic
We all guess when reading code. But to gain confidence, you need more than that.

You need to _see_ what happens as your program runs. So, you have some work to do, because, you need to think in code.

### You have to do it
No one learns to ride a bike from a book, or even a video. You learn by doing it. Actually, by _not_ doing it. You learn by doing it wrong, by falling off, by getting back on, by doing it again.

If you want to learn it, you have to do it.

### You have to discover and build your programming mental models.

Just like how you can easily recreate the interactions with a phone in your mind, you’re going to build mental models that will enable you to reasily recreate the interactions of a program in your mind.

But first, a question.

## Part 1: What is code?
Etymologically (in a way that relates to the origin and history of words), code is a _systematic compilation of laws_.

And the oldest known law code is the [Code of Ur-Nammu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Ur-Nammu).

But that’s not quite the code we will be talking about today.

The code we’re going to talk about today can still be considered a _systematic compilation of laws_, but more specifically it is a system of laws to express information and instructions to computers and other humans.

_Program_ comes from the meaning “a definite line of procedure prepared or announced beforehand”.

And by the end of this, I hope to instill you with the confidence to call yourself a programmer–one who creates programs.

There are many galaxies in the coding universe. Depending on the paths you take, you may visit many of them or focus on just one.

Regardless of the _language_, the principles, the fundamentals of programming are largely the same.

You may think of programming as _writing code_. But, in reality, programming is much more about _reading code_.

Code is read by _both_ computers and other humans.

However, computers don’t read code like we do. Computers don’t have to guess the meaning of code from variable names or by noticing patterns. Computers read code according to the rules created by other humans decades ago.

Code is similar to this language (English)–in fact they’re are coding _languages_.

And as you know, different languages are used in different areas. But the basics of every languages are mostly the same.
