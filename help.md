The material covered in this class is confusing, and I’m confident there are plenty of you with questions. This is a great time to ask them.

## Let’s Meet (Online)
I hope we can make this collaborative instead of something like an additional lecture.

You don’t have to turn your camera on. I’ll have mine on but don‘t feel pressured to turn yours on if you don’t want to.

Try to make your questions specific.

Asking ”What’s wrong with my code?” is not specific. If the code is only few lines than this could be okay.

When there’s many lines of code, identify the location of your question:
- “What’s wrong with the statement on line X?”
- “What’s wrong with the loop on line X?”
- “What’s wrong with the condition on line X?”

Asking better questions is of great help as a programmer and elsewhere.
